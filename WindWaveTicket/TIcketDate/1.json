    The great majority of large breakers seen at a beach result from distant winds.

    Five factors influence the formation of the flow structures in wind waves:
    1. Wind speed or strength relative to wave speed;
    2. The wind blows without significant change in direction;
    3. Width of the area affected by fetch;
    4. The time for which the wind has blown over the water;
    5. Water depth.",
